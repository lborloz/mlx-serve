/// What a My Models row lets you DO, as pure functions the row reads.
///
/// The row shipped with two controls: "Use", and — depending on where the file
/// lived — either a trash or `externaldrive.badge.icloud`, a glyph that reads
/// as "external drive" or "cloud" and meant neither. It was an `Image`, not a
/// `Button`, so clicking it did nothing. For every model outside
/// `~/.mlx-serve/models` that glyph WAS the row's entire answer to "where is
/// this file and how do I get rid of it".
///
/// Three answers now, and the logic lives here rather than inside the view so
/// it can be tested:
///
/// * **Reveal** — every row, no exceptions. Six other panes already had it;
///   this one, the only pane that is ABOUT files on disk, did not.
/// * **Lock, then trash** — a foreign tree still starts locked, because
///   deleting another app's working model by accident is worth one click of
///   friction. But the lock is now the click that removes the friction, not a
///   wall: these are all apps the user runs, on the user's disk.
/// * **Right-click** — the same actions, where people look for them.
