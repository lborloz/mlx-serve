/// screen saying why. This blocks instead, and offers the SAME starter
/// recommendation the welcome window does (`RecommendedStarterCard`, one view,
/// one `starterPick`), so the two can't drift.
///
/// It fires on chat-CAPABLE models, not on "any model": someone whose only
/// download is an image backend has a full models folder and still can't send
/// a message. And it clears itself — `AppState.localModels` is `@Published`
/// and the card refreshes it when the transfer lands.
///
/// Cancel ends the sheet and keeps the window open, so the app can be explored
/// before any download; the sheet returns when the window next opens.
