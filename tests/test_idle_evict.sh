# --idle-evict-secs: a model nobody is using leaves residency, and the next
# request cold-loads it back.
#
# The reload this makes routine is also what the test is for. Three endpoints
# read an entry's RETAINED CPU state (config, chat template) without holding a
# refcount — /api/tags, /api/show, and the pre-load text-gen gate on a chat
# request — and a reload frees that state. So each cycle fires all three
# concurrently with the reload. Residency is read back from /api/ps rather than
# trusting the `state` field: "unloaded" with the memory still held is the
# failure this flag exists to prevent.

# Usage: ./tests/test_idle_evict.sh [root] [port]
