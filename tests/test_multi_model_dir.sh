# `--model-dir` is REPEATABLE, and every folder it names is actually served.
#
# Before this the flag took ONE directory, so a user whose models lived in more
# than one place (the app's download folder, the folder it used to be, an
# LM Studio tree) had the rest listed by the app's own picker and absent from
# /v1/models — switching to one cost a full server restart instead of a hot
# swap, because the id was not in the registry.
#
# FULLY HERMETIC: the "models" are empty dirs holding a config.json. Nothing is
# ever loaded — this pins DISCOVERY and the arg loop, which is where the bug was.
#
# Usage: ./tests/test_multi_model_dir.sh [port]
